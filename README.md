This site displays some of my favorite images that were created using the
[Prisma app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prisma-free-photo-editor-art/id1122649984?mt=8).

Prisma uses neural networks and artificial intelligence to combine the style of
one image with another image.

Clicking on an image pops up a modal with the before and after images.

All images are my own.
